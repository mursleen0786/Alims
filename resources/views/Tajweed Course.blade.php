		<h3>Define Tajweed</h3>
		  <p>Tajweed is a set of rules for the correct pronunciation of the letters with all its qualities and applying the various recitations. When reciting the Qur’an, it means giving every letter of the Qur’an its rights and dues of characteristics and observing the rules that apply to those letters in different situations. We give them their dues by observing the characteristics of each letter that are present in them some of the time and not present at other times.</p>
