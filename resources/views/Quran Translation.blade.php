		<h1 class="display-4">What is The Quran?</h1>
		 <p class="lead">The word “Tajweed” means to improve, to do better.Tajweed of the Holy Quran is the knowledge and application of the rules of recitation, so the reading of the Quran is as recited by our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Mercy of Allah be upon him)<br>- by Sheikh Mustafa</p>
		  <hr class="my-4">
		<h3>Define Quran</h3>
		  <p>Tajweed is a set of rules for the correct pronunciation of the letters with all its qualities and applying the various recitations. When reciting the Qur’an, it means giving every letter of the Qur’an its rights and dues of characteristics and observing the rules that apply to those letters in different situations. We give them their dues by observing the characteristics of each letter that are present in them some of the time and not present at other times.</p>

		<h2>How can you learn Quran?</h2>
		  <p>Tajweed and its importance can only be studied with a teacher. Online Quran Teachers are the best at teaching Quran with tajweed.The same rules can be studied independently, but their correct use can only be achieved by hearing, chanting and being corrected by a qualified Quran teacher.In the days of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), there was no need to study tajweed because they spoke with tajweed.It was natural for them to speak with tajweed. Now, more than 14 centuries later, regional Arabic has radically changed from the classical Arabic with which the Quran was revealed, and Arabs have to study tajweed, in precisely the same way as non-Arabs.If you want to learn Quran with Tajweed online, but you do not know where to start. We are here for you.The basic is to find a best online Quran teacher i.e., Online Quran Teachers who will listen to you and point out the mistakes, and help you to practice the correction. You have to learn the Arabic lyrics and vowels too.Online Quran Teachers will teach you based on repetition, the student and the teacher will work together on the pronunciation of the letters obtaining a description of the points of connection.And we’ll teach you to practice placing the tongue, the lips and looking for the place in the throat from where the letter is uttered and compare it with the lyrics when you listen to them in the audios that we will send you after each class.If you want to learn the Arabic language, you need to know its principles so that you can get an idea of the language to get explored. Several laws in the art of Tajweed must be understood.</p>

      <h4>AYAH N.</h4>
      <p>My name is Ayah. I love Arabic very much and I enjoy it and through out my life I enjoyed grammar and considered it like a hobby. I had a great teacher for this. My teachers made it easiy for me to study the Arabic language and literature and therefore this is my mission to help others experience what I did. I decided to teach non-native speakers to help them understand the Holy Quran. I have a good experience in memorizing the Quran and reviewing it for all age groups, as well as a good follow-up of the means and methods of modern teaching online and the latest research and studies in that area.</p>

      <h4>HAYTHAM E.</h4>
      <p>Asalam Alikum, as a servant of Allah, I am in love with teaching Arabic to non-native speakers. The status of the Arabic language emanates from the honor of the Holy Quran. This language is characterized by its accuracy and difficulty. I strive to give my students tools to overcome this difficulty including explanation and clarification using all means in an attractive and engaging manner until the goal is achieved taking into account the differences between the beginner, intermediate and advanced level students. I adhere to the classical Arabic language and not the colloquial in the management of the lesson, whether the Koran or the Arabic language in order to accustom the student’s to hearing the Arabic language, even if the student did not understand some of the words at first. My style is to resort to the use of the language of the student when explaining only in limited forms which yields better results. I use educational aids through some games to develop language. Interaction and interaction and then interaction with the student is the basis of teaching the foreign language through different means. Developing all skills for the student without forgetting one of them from reading, writing, speaking and listening is a key goal of mine.</p>
